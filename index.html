        <p>Hey Class<br> My name is Lindsey and this is my first JavaScript course. When I started taking college courses I was looking into an accounting degree. When I was 22 I enlisted in the Marine Corps and because of the type of contract I signed I
            was placed into a Communications Platoon. I would maintain telephone and networks on tactical networks. The military introduced me to the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy (MSSA) course that is hosted by Embry-Riddle. Besides that boot
            camp I am new to the software industry. <br> I am excited about this class because I am learning JavaScript and I recently started a position with Microsoft as a Front-end Developer for Azure. I am hoping to gain a strong foundation with web
            design so I can contribute to my team and grow as an engineer.</p>
